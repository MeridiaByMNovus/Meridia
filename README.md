Meridia is a modern IDE designed for developers. While its core focus is Python, it now **supports multiple programming languages** including JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Bash, Java, C, C++, Lua, Swift, SQL, and more. This means you can **write, run, and manage projects in different languages without leaving the IDE**.

It combines a clean, minimal design with powerful tools for coding, data workflows, and visualization—all in one place.
